# Cocoa_Analysis


In a way, underdevelopment is a paradox. Many parts of the world that are naturally rich are actually poor, and parts that are not so well off in wealth of soil and subsoil are enjoying the highest standards of living.

## PROBLEM

1. Despite cocoa being the most important ingredient of chocolate, (making up ~75% of chocolate’s content), it only makes up about 20% of the chocolate pipeline trade value.
2. Cocoa has a higher impact on its exporters’ GDP than chocolate does on its exporters’ GDP yet the profit they make from cocoa is sub-optimal.
3. Africa is missing out on the ROI of the chocolate business.
4. Europe gains a lot more cultural recognition for making chocolate and even for cocoa than Africa does for growing cocoa
